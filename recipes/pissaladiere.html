        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pissaladière is a tart made on either a pizza-like dough or puff pastry. It can be rectangular or circular. It is similar to pizza, except instead of sauce there's a bed of sweet caramelized onions. Instead of cheese or toppings, there is a harlequin pattern of anchovy fillets and niçoise olives. It's the perfect combination of sweet and salty, and the crust is doughy, chewy, and crispy all at once. It's so satisfying as an afternoon snack, or as a light meal with a glass of chilled wine.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound store-bought or homemade pizza dough</li>
            <li>Olive oil</li>
            <li>1 can (2-ounce) anchovies packed in olive oil</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 medium onions, thinly sliced (about 4 cups)</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pitted Niçoise olives</li>
            <li>2 stems fresh thyme</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Adjust oven rack to middle position and preheat the oven to 475°F. Shape dough into ball and place in medium bowl coated lightly with olive oil. Cover tightly with plastic and set aside at room temperature.</li>
            <li>Add 2 tablespoons olive oil to heavy-bottomed 12-inch sauté pan and heat over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add onions and season to taste with salt. Reduce heat to low and cook, stirring frequently until golden brown, about 40 minutes. If onions start to turn black, stir in one tablespoon water and continue to cook. Transfer to small bowl and allow to cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Roll dough on well-floured work surface with rolling pin into even circle about 12-inches in diameter and 1/2-inch thick. Transfer to rimmed baking sheet. Spread onions evenly over surface, leaving one-inch border.</li>
            <li>Scatter anchovies, olives, and thyme sprigs over surface of the pissaladiere. Season lightly with salt (anchovies and olives are salty), and drizzle with remaining tablespoon olive oil. Bake until the crust is golden, puffed, and crisp, about 15 minutes. Serve cold</li>
